A Movierulz Proxy is essentially a tool that acts as an intermediary between your device and the Movierulz website. It forwards your requests to the website and brings back the responses, allowing you to access and browse the site even if it's blocked or restricted in your geographical location. The proxy masks your IP address, making it appear as if you are accessing the site from a different location where the site might not be blocked. This provides a way to bypass restrictions and access the content you want, while also offering a degree of privacy and anonymity. However, it's important to use such tools responsibly and in accordance with the law.
